# Morse Code Information

## What is Morse Code?
Morse code is a communication system that uses dots (.) and dashes (-) to represent letters and numbers. It was developed for long-distance communication before telephones existed.

## Historical Background
Invented in the 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail, Morse code was used in telegraphs. It helped people send messages quickly across long distances using electrical signals.

## How It Works
Each English letter and number has a unique combination of dots and dashes.
- Dot = short signal
- Dash = long signal

### Morse Code Alphabet Example:
- A = .-
- B = -...
- C = -.-.
- D = -..
- E = .
- F = ..-.

### Example Word:
"HELLO" in Morse Code:
- H = ....
- E = .
- L = .-..
- L = .-..
- O = ---
